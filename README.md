# SL-StarTrekTracker

Trying to learn React by making a small personal website where I can track the average rating of Star Trek episodes and films as I go through the series.

This project uses data from The Movie Database (TMDb) API. More information about TMDb can be found on their [website](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
